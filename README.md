### Welcome! These are some recent projects I've made.

[Vanilla](https://github.com/simplygreatwork/vanilla) has super clean tiny libraries for reactive bus messaging, url routing, and components for client-side JavaScript views.

[Textbase](https://github.com/simplygreatwork/textbase) is a clean, simple, composable, event-driven, rich text editor framework for the web which can be extended with custom block and inline elements in a non-opinionated manner.

[Obvious](https://github.com/simplygreatwork/obvious) offers a way to learn quantum computing using a small, hackable, optimized framework with [examples](https://github.com/simplygreatwork/obvious/tree/master/examples).

[Pluck](https://github.com/simplygreatwork/pluck) is a programming language construction kit. Get started with WebAssembly text format syntax and macros.

[Callbag Cookbook](https://github.com/simplygreatwork/callbag-cookbook) includes examples of using reactive, asynchronous data streams in the browser (as callbags). This is an [older repository](https://github.com/simplygreatwork/streaming) dabbling with callbags.

[Inverted CSS](https://github.com/simplygreatwork/inverted-css) is an a CSS-in-JS library which flattens CSS to be property first, then selectors, then media queries. So, for example, you could group every background color adjustment as a single logical group.

[Ordering Tree](https://github.com/simplygreatwork/ordering-tree) is a very simple kernel, the basis of a minimum viable product, for an ordering system.

[Godsend](https://github.com/simplygreatwork/godsend) is a simple and eloquent workflow for streaming messages to micro-services with [examples](https://github.com/simplygreatwork/godsend-examples/tree/master/examples).

[Goodshow](https://github.com/simplygreatwork/goodshow) is an entity-component user interface library for WebGL - leaning toward Material Design.

[Goodshow DOM](https://github.com/simplygreatwork/goodshow-dom) is an entity-component user interface library for DOM - leaning toward Material Design. It's an incomplete port of the WebGL edition of Goodshow.
